Implemented remainder tree for general integer inputs and mods with tree data structure and recursive structure. Runtime graph plotted.

More runtime graphs created and compared. Studied from the literature. Experimented with different recursive tree structures.

Got confused about recursion tree; tried to set up Linux or Visual Studio or any way to run C++ code.
